So far we have seen examples of how we can extend the functionality and interactivity of existing figures, especially images, movies and 3D plots. 
This is only scratching the surface however - because we can embed code directly into our manuscript, we can create arbitrarily complex widgets. 
For example, here is an interactive version of the 1D FFT:


:::{figure} #app:custom_fft
:name: fig_fft_1d
:placeholder: ./figures/fft_1d.png
Teaching widget for the one-dimensional FFT.
