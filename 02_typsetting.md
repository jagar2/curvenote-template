## Paper Layout

Your paper should be divided into logical sections. We recommend using different markdown files as "chapters" of your paper, and then sub-sections inside each file using markdown titles. You can reference any section or subsection, for example we can reference the current section as {ref}`paper_layout`, a section further down this page TODO, or any section or sub-section from other chapters such as the [Introduction](01_intro) or {ref}`summary`.

We require four sections in the `index.md` file:
* Abstract
* Code and Data Availability
* Acknowledgements
* Competing Interests
