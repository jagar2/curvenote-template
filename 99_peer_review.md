Manuscripts in this journal may be published as pre-prints, though with a required notification that they have not yet undergone peer review.  After peer review, all exchanges with the referees will be published alongside the article. Reviewers may opt out of publishing their names and remain anonymous. However, publishing reviews under your own name can allow for better recognition of peer review service, and even place authors and reviewers on an even footing.




## First Report


### Reviewer 1

I enjoyed reading this paper, and it's an excellent contribution to the field of microscopy.

`We thank the referee for their valuable comments.`


### Reviewer 2

This paper is poorly-written, the topic covered is dull, and other grumpy comments.

`We respectfully disgree.`


### Reviewer 3

While this study is valuable, the authors should perform several challenging new experiments. This would generalize their results and make their contributions more useful to the microscopy community.

`We have performed as many of the requested experiments as possible. Our students are tired, so very tired.`
